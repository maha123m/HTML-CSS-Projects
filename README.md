# HTML-CSS-Project (Ecommerce Website)
## Project Description
This project involves designing an e-commerce website, specifically focusing on creating the homepage. The homepage will include the following elements: 

1) Banner section with eye-catching visuals.
2) Featured categories with images.
3) Featured products displaying product price, images, and ratings.  
4) A section showcasing the latest products.
5) An exclusive offer section featuring a special product.
6) Testimonials from satisfied customers.
7) A section highlighting top brands.

Additionally, the project aims to make the website design responsive for mobile devices and implement a dropdown menu for mobile screens. 
In the next phase of the project, we plan to create pages for all products, a single product page, a shopping cart page, and login and 
registration pages for the e-commerce website.
